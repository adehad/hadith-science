# Nuzhat al-Naẓar, visualised: design

Date: 2026-10-28
Status: reviewed, awaiting owner approval
Concept mockup: https://claude.ai/artifact/8V78csjQ1dFRqbjoWoZza1 (reference for look and motion; not production code)

## 1. Goal

A public static website that teaches the hadith sciences in Ibn Ḥajar's *Nuzhat al-Naẓar* visually. Each concept is shown as one animated diagram instead of a page of prose. It is the companion a student keeps open beside the text.

Success means all of these hold:

- Every term Ibn Ḥajar defines appears on some page, with a § reference.
- Each term has a shareable link that lands on its diagram.
- The site reads correctly in light and dark themes, on desktop and on a phone.
- The site works with reduced motion and with a screen reader.

### Out of scope

- Full text of the translation.
- Commentary from the thesis the translation sits in.
- User accounts, comments, search beyond the glossary filter, and translations of the UI.

## 2. Source and copyright

- **Primary source:** Ibn Ḥajar, *Nuzhat al-Naẓar*, in the English translation inside A. S. Hussain's 2012 thesis (`Nuzhat al-Nazar - Ibn Hajar.pdf`). The thesis says "further distribution prohibited".
- **Rules that follow from the copyright:**
  - Site text is written fresh in our own words, never copied.
  - Every claim carries its § number, for example "§5.55".
  - No passage of the translation is reproduced beyond a few words of quoted Arabic terminology.
  - The thesis author's commentary and footnote analysis are not used.
- **Second source:** the repo owner's own PDF annotations (sticky notes, highlights, ink). They clarify the translation. They are extracted locally with pypdf, and the owner approves which notes are used.
- **Kept out of git:** the PDF, the extracted text and the annotation dumps all live in a git-ignored `source/` folder. CI fails if any of them is committed (§9).
- **Translation slips:**
  - Known so far: §5.20 muʿḍil, the p.159 "specified", §5.51 Sarrāj.
  - They are collected in `notes/translation-queries.md` for the owner to rule on.
  - Until a ruling, the site follows the Arabic term.

## 3. Visual language

These decisions were settled through the mockup.

### 3.1 Narrators

| Who | Look |
|---|---|
| The Prophet ﷺ | Full moon, ﷺ at the centre, slow pulsing glow |
| Companion (ṣaḥābī) | Gold, with a shimmer and a star |
| Successor (tābiʿī) | Green, with a band across the chest |
| Later narrator | Black (light ink in dark theme) |

Generation is shown by colour and by row only; there is no headwear.

### 3.2 Narrator assessment

A narrator figure carries two items:

- a **name scroll**, meaning his identity is known;
- a **seal**, meaning someone vouches for him.

A missing item shows as an empty slot that blinks.

| Case | Arabic | Figure |
|---|---|---|
| Reliable | ثِقَةٌ | scroll + seal |
| Unknown | مَجْهُولٌ | scroll + empty seal slot |
| Unnamed | مُبْهَمٌ | blank face, both slots empty |
| Weak | ضَعِيفٌ | cracked seal |
| Liar | كَذَّابٌ | mask, voided seal |
| Memory failed | مُخْتَلِطٌ | faded head |
| Conceals | مُدَلِّسٌ | hand over mouth |
| Missing link | سَقْطٌ | dashed red ghost |

### 3.3 Typography and text

- **Fonts:** Fraunces for display, Source Sans 3 for UI and body, Amiri for Arabic. All are self-hosted through `@fontsource` packages (no Google Fonts request), so preview builds, axe runs and screenshots are deterministic.
- **Arabic:** always fully voweled (full tashkeel, with case endings). It is marked `lang="ar" dir="rtl"` and shown with its transliteration.
- **Quoted delivery words** (for example حَدَّثَنِي رَجُلٌ) appear in a speech bubble coming from the narrator who says them, not as a caption under the person being described.

### 3.4 Motion

- **Chains:** arrows along a chain flow in the direction of narration (a stroke-dash animation).
- **Missing items:** blink.
- **Header:** a starfield whose stars drift and fade.
- **"Other views" switch:** elements animate to their new position and size; they are not redrawn.
- **Reduced motion:** `prefers-reduced-motion` turns off every animation, every transition and the view transitions.

### 3.5 Labels

- Info icons sit beside terms in the diagrams and open the term popover (§6); there are no caption rows.
- One popover serves both purposes: definition and share actions. It is an HTML overlay positioned over the SVG, because the HTML `popover` attribute doesn't work on SVG elements.
- A global **Key / Labels** switch shows either the symbol key overlay or inline labels.

### 3.6 Themes

- Colours are tokens on `:root`, with a dark set for `prefers-color-scheme: dark` and a manual override (`data-theme`).
- Contrast meets WCAG AA in both themes.

## 4. Information architecture

### 4.1 Home: the map

- Eight planets orbit the full moon (the Prophet ﷺ), one for each of Ibn Ḥajar's top-level divisions, in his order.
- Each planet's moons are its sub-divisions.
- Each planet is labelled with Ibn Ḥajar's term, with a plain-English name on a second line. Both labels travel with the planet; there are no fixed labels on the orbits.

| # | Term | English | § |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ʿAdad al-ṭuruq | How it reached us | 5.2–5.8 |
| 2 | al-Maqbūl | Accepted reports | 5.9–5.16 |
| 3 | al-Mardūd | Breaks in the chain · criticism of narrators | 5.17–5.39 |
| 4 | Muntahā al-isnād | Where the chain ends | 5.40–5.44 |
| 5 | Laṭāʾif al-isnād | Features of the chain | 5.45–5.54 |
| 6 | Ṣiyagh al-adāʾ | How it was passed on | 5.55–5.58 |
| 7 | al-Asmāʾ | Names that look alike | 5.59–5.61 |
| 8 | Maʿrifat al-ruwāt | Knowing the narrators | 5.62–5.71 |

Clicking a planet navigates to `/<division>/`, and the view transition (§5) makes this look like a zoom into the planet. That page shows the planet large, with its moons. Clicking a moon opens that scene.

### 4.2 Routes

| Route | Content |
|---|---|
| `/` | Map |
| `/<division>/` | The planet zoomed in, listing its scenes (also the fallback when JavaScript is off) |
| `/<division>/<scene>/` | One scene: one diagram |
| `/narrators/` | Full figure key (§3.1–3.2) |
| `/terms/` | Glossary: every term, its Arabic, a short definition, § and a link to its scene; filter box |
| `/t/<slug>/` | Share-link landing page for one term (§6) |
| `/404.html` | Themed not-found page with a link to the map |

Division slugs are ASCII transliterations, for example `adad-al-turuq` and `siyagh-al-ada`.

### 4.3 Scenes

A scene is one diagram that teaches one sub-division.

**Phase 2** (§10) builds the five scenes already proven in the mockup:

| Scene | Division | § | Diagram |
|---|---|---|---|
| How many routes carry it? | 1 | 5.2–5.6 | Chains fanning out for mutawātir, mashhūr, ʿazīz and gharīb |
| Where does the chain break? | 3 | 5.18–5.19 | Muʿallaq, mursal, muʿḍal and munqaṭiʿ shown as ghosts in a chain. Other view: some scholars' wider use of *mursal* |
| Who is this narrator? | 3 | 5.35–5.36 | Mubham vs majhūl; speech bubble "حَدَّثَنِي رَجُلٌ" |
| How was it received? | 6 | 5.55–5.58 | Ranked staircase: Ibn Ḥajar's eight delivery levels, with wijāda, waṣiyya, iʿlām and general ijāza "below the stairs". Other views: the scholars of Madīna; al-Bukhārī and others |
| Who is who? | 7 | 5.59–5.61 | Four panels: muttafiq/muftariq fork; muʾtalif/mukhtalif dot glyphs; mutashābih with the differing letters pulsing; a filter-box worked example narrowing to ʿAbd Allāh ibn Zayd ibn ʿAbd Rabbih |

The figure key from the mockup's "Reading a narrator" becomes `/narrators/`.

**Phase 3 onwards** adds the rest of the sub-divisions, one division at a time, in planet order.

- Each division gets its own short design pass: a mockup in the concept artifact for the owner to review, then a plan, then the build.
- Design rules for every scene:
  - Prefer a real worked example from the book over a generic one.
  - Pick the diagram form that fits the idea (staircase, filter box, fork, etc.) rather than forcing every idea into a chain.

Until a division is built, its planet still shows on the map, and its moons are listed as "coming soon".

## 5. Page layout and interaction

- **Header** on every page:
  - starfield behind the site title;
  - breadcrumb (Map › Division › Scene);
  - Key/Labels switch and theme switch, both saved in `localStorage`. Every storage access is wrapped in try/catch, and the page works without storage.
- **Main area:** one diagram per page.
  - Scenes with scholarly disagreement show Ibn Ḥajar's view by default, with an **Other views** switch.
  - The chosen view is kept in the URL (`?view=madinah`) so that a link opens on that view.
- **Under the diagram:**
  - previous/next links within the division;
  - a collapsible **Read as text** section listing the scene's captions in order, with Arabic and § references, for screen readers and search engines.
- **Footer:**
  - credits Ibn Ḥajar and the translation and states that the text is paraphrased;
  - links to `/terms/`, `/narrators/` and the repository.
- **Map to scene:** native cross-document view transitions (`@view-transition { navigation: auto; }`, declared inside `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` so reduced motion disables them without JavaScript, plus matching `view-transition-name`s) morph the planet into the division page and the moon into the scene.
  - Astro's `<ClientRouter />` is **not** used. Every navigation is a full page load, so islands only need to initialise once on load.
  - Browsers without support (currently Firefox) get plain navigation. Without JavaScript, these are plain links.
- **Keyboard:** planets and info icons can be reached with Tab and opened with Enter or Space.
- **Mobile, under about 640px:**
  - The SVG scales to the screen width.
  - Tooltips open as a bottom panel when tapped.
  - Orbits slow down.
  - **Carousel:** a scene that declares `panels` (for example "How many routes", the figure key) becomes a swipe carousel in portrait.
    - The diagram is rendered **once**: there is a single SVG and no duplicated markup, so IDs, markers and view-switch targets stay unique.
    - Panels are horizontal slices of the diagram, each defined by an x-range in diagram units. A scene that uses panels must lay its diagram out as a single row.
    - In portrait, the SVG is set wider than the screen (the panel count × the viewport width) inside a horizontally scrolling container. Invisible snap targets, one per panel and positioned from the x-ranges, give CSS scroll-snap its stops.
    - It has page dots and previous/next buttons, and needs no library.
    - Landscape, and anything wider, removes the overflow and shows the full diagram at 100% width.
    - The switch is done by CSS media query (`orientation` and width), so rotating the phone switches the layout straight away.
    - Scenes laid out as a grid (for example "Who is who?") don't use panels. Each cell is its own small SVG inside an HTML CSS grid, which becomes a single column in portrait. There is still only one copy of each cell.

## 6. Shareable term links

- **Slugs:** every term has a stable ASCII slug in the term inventory, for example `mutawatir`, `mursal` or `ijaza-amma`.
- **Term on a page:** a button. Clicking or tapping it opens a popover with:
  - the term, its Arabic and a one-line definition;
  - **Copy link**;
  - **Share**, using `navigator.share` where available and hidden otherwise;
  - **See in glossary**.
- **Canonical share link:** `/t/<slug>/`.
  - This is a generated static page with Open Graph tags (term, Arabic, definition), so it shows a proper card when pasted into a chat.
  - It redirects to the term's place with `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` plus `<link rel="canonical">`, so it works without JavaScript. The canonical URL is absolute (`SITE` + `BASE`); the refresh target is base-relative so the redirect also works on preview hosts; `og:url` is the `/t/<slug>/` URL itself, so link cards stay stable.
- **Short forms:** any page also accepts `?t=<slug>`, or a bare `?<slug>`.
  - **What counts as a bare slug:** a query string that is exactly one key with no value, where that key is not a reserved word (`t`, `view`, `q`). Anything else is ignored. The build fails if a slug equals a reserved word.
  - **How it resolves:** a tiny inline script checks `location.search`. Only when one of these shapes is present does it fetch a build-generated `terms-index.json` (its URL includes `BASE`) (slug → target URL) and redirect with `location.replace`. Pages without a slug query never load the index.
- **Landing:** the target URL is `/<division>/<scene>/?view=<v>#<slug>`.
  - `view` is added only when the term appears only under a non-default view.
  - Term elements carry `data-term="<slug>"` rather than an `id`. The `termlink` island reads the hash, finds the element, and scrolls to it; in a portrait carousel it first snaps to the panel containing the element. It then draws a pulse ring round the term and opens its popover.
- **Pending terms** (in a division not yet built, §9):
  - `/t/<slug>/` is still generated.
  - It and the short forms redirect to the term's glossary entry, `/terms/#<slug>`. That entry shows "coming soon" and links to the division page.
- **Unknown slug:** `?t=<unknown>` and `/t/` URLs that don't exist open `/terms/?q=<slug>` with the filter pre-filled and a "no exact match" note. An unknown bare `?<key>` is ignored, so stray tracking keys never bounce visitors. A `/t/<x>/` URL that doesn't exist is served by `404.html`, which has a small script that spots the `/t/` path and redirects to `/terms/?q=<x>`.

## 7. Architecture

### 7.1 Stack

- **Astro + TypeScript, static output.** Chosen for reusable components, content collections with schema validation, one URL per page, good SEO by default, and small client islands.
- No UI framework. Client islands are plain TypeScript modules.
- **Bun** is the package manager and script runtime (`bun install`, `bun --bun astro …`).
- **prek** runs the hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` locally and in CI.

### 7.2 Layout

```

```

### 7.3 Scene content file

Each scene's YAML holds:

- **Header data:** id, division, title, § range.
- **Captions:** each has a term slug, Arabic (voweled), English and a paraphrased tooltip.
- **Views:** an optional list. Each view has an id, a label, the scholars it reflects with §, and the per-element targets that differ from the default view.
- **Panels:** optional, for the mobile carousel. Each panel has an id, a label and an x-range in diagram units (§5).
- **Diagram:** the name of the Astro diagram component, plus its props.

Content and drawing are separate:

- The diagram component draws the scene.
- The YAML supplies its words and data.
- A scene can be reworded without touching any drawing code.

### 7.4 Client behaviour

- **Islands:** each one is a plain module included only on pages that need it. It initialises once on load, since there is no client-side router.
- **Reduced motion:** JS-driven motion (the starfield canvas and the planet orbits, which use `requestAnimationFrame`) checks `prefers-reduced-motion` and draws one static frame instead of animating.
- **View switching:**
  - Each element carries its target transforms as data attributes.
  - Switching applies the new targets in the frame after layout, so CSS transitions run. This is the mockup's staircase technique.
  - Under reduced motion the switch is immediate.
- **Missing data:** a scene's YAML is validated at build time (§9), so runtime code assumes valid data. A runtime error in an island leaves the static SVG in place.

## 8. Hosting

- **Production: GitHub Pages**, from a public repository `adehad/hadith-science`, deployed by GitHub Actions.
- **Branch previews: Cloudflare.**
  - A `wrangler.toml` at the repo root follows the pattern of the owner's dhikr-hub repo:
    ```toml
    # Cloudflare Workers & Pages config
    name = "hadith-science"
    compatibility_date = "2026-10-28"

    [assets]
    directory = "./dist/"
    not_found_handling = "404-page"
    ```
  - The repo is connected to Cloudflare Workers Builds in the dashboard, with build command `bun install && bun run build`. This is a one-off manual step for the owner. Every branch then gets a preview URL.
- **Base path:**
  - GitHub Pages serves the site under `/hadith-science/`; Cloudflare previews serve it at `/`.
  - `astro.config` reads `SITE` and `BASE` from the environment. The Pages workflow sets them from `actions/configure-pages`. The defaults are `/` for Cloudflare and local builds.
  - Every internal link goes through `lib/url.ts`, which normalises `BASE` to exactly one leading and one trailing slash. A test checks this (§9).
  - `404.html` is served at arbitrary depths by GitHub Pages, so its links are root-absolute (including `BASE`).
- **Owner setup notes for Cloudflare:** the Worker name in the dashboard must equal `name` in `wrangler.toml`. Non-production branches use the default `bunx wrangler versions upload` deploy command to get preview URLs.

## 8a. Installable app (PWA)

- A web app manifest (name, icons incl. maskable, `display: standalone`, night-sky theme colour) with relative `start_url` and `scope`, so it installs from both GitHub Pages (`/hadith-science/`) and previews (`/`).
- A service worker generated after the build by Workbox (`generateSW`) precaches the built pages, styles, scripts, fonts and icons (not the `/t/` redirects), so the site reads offline after the first visit. Precached pages are served from the cache; each deploy changes their revisions and the new worker takes over immediately (the first navigation after a deploy may still show the old page). Pages outside the precache are network-first with a cache fallback. Outdated caches are cleaned on update.
- Registered only in production builds, scoped to the base path.
- Tests: manifest validity and icons, service worker registration, offline navigation to cached pages.

## 9. Testing and CI

- **Content validation at build:**
  - Astro content collections check every division, scene and term file against a zod schema.
  - A scene that names an unknown term slug fails the build.
  - A term in the inventory that no scene uses fails the build. A term can be marked `pending` while its division is unbuilt; pending terms are listed in the glossary as "coming soon".
- **Type check:** `astro check`.
- **Unit tests (Vitest):**
  - slug resolution, including view-only terms and unknown slugs;
  - staircase, orbit and panel layout maths;
  - `?view=` read/write;
  - the base-aware URL helper.
- **Playwright** (Chromium):
  - Every route renders with no console errors and passes an axe accessibility scan, in both themes.
  - Every built (non-pending) term: `/t/<slug>/` and `?<slug>` both land on the right scene with the popover open, including in a portrait carousel.
  - Every pending term lands on its glossary entry.
  - An unknown bare key is ignored, and `?t=<unknown>` opens the glossary filter.
  - The view switch updates the URL and moves the elements, which end at their target positions.
  - Mobile portrait (390×844) shows the carousel; mobile landscape (844×390) shows the full diagram.
  - With reduced motion emulated, `document.getAnimations()` is empty. The starfield canvas and the planet positions are also unchanged after one second, because they are drawn with `requestAnimationFrame` and `getAnimations()` doesn't see them.
  - Built HTML contains no internal link that bypasses the base path. Checked by building with `BASE=/hadith-science/` and crawling, including the `/t/` refresh and canonical URLs, the `terms-index.json` fetch URL and `404.html`.
- **README screenshots:**
  - A separate Playwright project captures the map and each scene (desktop and mobile, light and dark) into `docs/screenshots/`.
  - `bun run screenshots` refreshes them locally and they are committed by hand. CI runs the project to prove it works but does not commit.
  - They are documentation, not visual-regression baselines.
- **Copyright guard:**
  - `source/` is git-ignored.
  - A CI step fails if any `*.pdf`, `nuzhah*.txt` or annotation dump is tracked.
- **Workflows:**
  - Pull requests: install, `astro check`, Vitest, build, Playwright.
  - Pushes to `main`: the same steps, then deploy to GitHub Pages.
  - Cloudflare builds previews independently.

## 10. Delivery phases

1. **Foundation.**
   - Repo, tooling, CI, Pages and Cloudflare config, copyright guard.
   - Tokens, layout, header/footer, the map with all eight divisions.
   - Term inventory for the whole book; terms in unbuilt divisions are marked `pending`.
   - Glossary, figure key, share-link system.
2. **Mocked scenes.** The five scenes in §4.3, ported from the mockup into components and content files, with tests and screenshots.
3. **One phase per remaining division,** in planet order. Each phase starts with a mockup review in the concept artifact.

Each phase has its own implementation plan.

## 11. Open items

- Translation queries (§2) await the owner's ruling.
- Which annotations are used: `notes/annotation-usage.md` is drafted in phase 1 for the owner's approval.
- Highlight and ink annotations have no text attached. Their text has to be recovered from the PDF using the annotation coordinates (QuadPoints) in phase 1.
